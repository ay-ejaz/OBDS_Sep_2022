This is the pathway analysis practical of the OBDS course 
- The first part of this pracical is using gprofiler to perform ORA on output dataset of differentially expressed genes from DESeq2

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# load packages
# load librarys

library(tidyverse)
library(gprofiler2)
```

# Read in our tables from this morning in a new Rmd file
```{r}
# read in files from this morning
# 1. all results (this was filtered to remove non DE genes in our DESeq2 list so only contains genes expressed in our samples) -> call this table 'all_genes_df'  - this will be our background

all_genes_df <- read_csv('CD8_vs_CD4_DE_results_lfcshrinkage_allgenes.csv')
dim(all_genes_df)

#filter out the genes which padj is NA - this will not be present in the up/downregulated files which will all have a pvalue.
all_genes_df_filtered <- all_genes_df %>% filter(!is.na(padj))
dim(all_genes_df_filtered)

# 2. all significant upregulated genes -> call this upreg_genes_df
upreg_genes_df <- read_csv('CD8_vs_CD4_DKO_DE_results_lfcshrinkage_0.05_log2FC1_up.csv')
dim(upreg_genes_df)

# 3. all significant down regulated genes -> call this downreg_genes_df 
downreg_genes_df <- read_csv('CD8_vs_CD4_DKO_DE_results_lfcshrinkage_0.05_log2FC1_down.csv')
dim(downreg_genes_df)

# Check the dimensions of each of your dataframes using dim()
# upreg_genes_df should be 915
# downreg_genes_df should be 1204
# all_genes_df_filtered should be 17729

```
Now we want a vector of gene ids to use for analysis 

```{r}
# from each of these dataframes get a vector of the ensembl ids 
all_gene_ids <- all_genes_df_filtered$ensembl_gene_id
    
upreg_gene_ids <- upreg_genes_df$ensembl_gene_id
    
downreg_gene_ids <- downreg_genes_df$ensembl_gene_id
class(downreg_gene_ids)
```

#Perform ORA using g:profiler 

1. Look at documentation - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gprofiler2/vignettes/gprofiler2.html
```{r}
# use the gost() function - what paramters should we include/change 
# we want to test the ORA of upreg_gene_ids vs our all_gene_ids

# get help for function
?gost() 

# write query and assign to output variable named `gost_results_obj`

gost_results_obj <- gost(query = upreg_gene_ids, organism = "mmusculus",
                         ordered_query = FALSE, multi_query = FALSE,
                         significant = TRUE, exclude_iea = TRUE,
                         measure_underrepresentation = FALSE,
                         evcodes = FALSE, user_threshold = 0.01,
                         correction_method = "g_SCS",
                         domain_scope = "custom", 
                         custom_bg = all_gene_ids,
                         sources = NULL,
                         as_short_link = FALSE)

# what are our outputs  
names(gost_results_obj)

```

```{r}
# plot our results using in built function in gprofiler -> which one is it? 

gostplot(gost_results_obj, capped = TRUE, interactive = FALSE)


```

```{r}
# what does as_short_link = FALSE do in gost() function? 
gost_results_obj_link <- gost(query = upreg_gene_ids, organism = "mmusculus",
                         ordered_query = FALSE, multi_query = FALSE,
                         significant = TRUE, exclude_iea = TRUE,
                         measure_underrepresentation = FALSE,
                         evcodes = FALSE, user_threshold = 0.01,
                         correction_method = "g_SCS",
                         domain_scope = "custom", 
                         custom_bg = all_gene_ids,
                         sources = NULL,
                         as_short_link = TRUE)

gost_results_obj_link
```

Answer -> outputs a weblink that can be used to interact with the data and shows a plot

```{r}
# Filter results table for genesets with between 5-300 genes 

gost_results_obj$result

```


2. Try querying multiple gene lists at the same time (up and down regulated genes) using Multiple queries - see the documentation 

```{r}

```

Can you plot these querys together?

```{r}


```

Output the get_version_info() to save the versions of the databases that were used for the analysis!! 
```{r}
get_version_info(organism= 'mmusculus') #to look at version of gprofiler

sessionInfo() #to get R version and packages used
```

```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

 
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
